    <p><b>Grade: 2</b> - In this case, the audio contains some abrupt cuts and in some cases it is very hard to understand the words that are supposed to be said, therefore not
        making this submission good enough to achieve the skill.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="example">
    <iframe width="620" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xuprS5VwCQ">
    </iframe>
</div>
<div class="feedback">
    <p><b>Grade: 3</b> - While the overall message can be understood, there are some noticiable rough cuts thoughout the video, making the video good enough to pass this skill, but
        not good enough to be considered a 4.</p>
